# node-sample-server

This is a very simple Node.js project, designed to simulate a dummy API at URL: localhost:3000/dummyApi . 
You can throw a dummy response, by configuring response status, headers(to be appended) and data(JSON content), in response.json file.

This is intended for app developers like me, to use as a dummy server in times of dire need, when the backend is down. :)
